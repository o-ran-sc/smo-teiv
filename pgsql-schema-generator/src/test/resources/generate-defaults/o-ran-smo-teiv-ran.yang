            A gNB may consist of a gNB-Centralized Unit (gNB-CU) and a gNB-DU.
            The CU processes non-real time protocols and services, and the DU
            processes PHY level protocol and real time services. The gNB-CU and
            the gNB-DU units are connected via F1 logical interface.

            The following is true for a gNB-DU:
            Is connected to the gNB-CU-CP through the F1-C interface. Is
            connected to the gNB-CU-UP through the F1-U interface. One gNB-DU is
            connected to only one gNB-CU-CP. One gNB-DU can be connected to
            multiple gNB-CU-UPs under the control of the same gNB-CU-CP.

            Note: A gNB may consist of a gNB-CU-CP, multiple gNB-CU-UPs and
            multiple gNB-DUs. gNB-DU is a concrete class that extends the NG-RAN

            the gNB-DU object.";
